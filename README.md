## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 38th Frontend Mentor Coding Challenge.


Completed a Frontend Mentor challenge to build an agency landing page, focusing on HTML and CSS to test layout and responsive design skills. The project involved creating a visually appealing and functional website with a minimal JavaScript addition for the mobile menu, emphasizing clean, structured code and a user-friendly experience across all devices.

**Had fun building this!** ðŸš€
